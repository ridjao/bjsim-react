- **Developer mode** for testing specific card scenarios
- **Basic strategy hints** to help improve gameplay
- **Hand history** showing detailed results of each hand played

### ðŸ“Š Simulator Mode
- **Large-scale simulations** supporting up to 10 million hands
- **Multiple strategies** including Basic Strategy and Conservative Strategy
- **Comprehensive statistics** matching interactive mode metrics
- **Progress indicator** with real-time updates for long-running simulations
- **Detailed hand tracking** for smaller simulations (â‰¤1000 hands)
- **Configurable parameters** for number of players, decks, and game count

### ðŸŽ¯ Game Features
- **Accurate blackjack rules** including proper payouts (3:2 for blackjacks)
- **Multiple deck support** (1, 2, 4, 6, or 8 decks)
- **Split hands support** with independent play of each hand
- **Double down** functionality with proper betting mechanics
- **Surrender option** for strategic play
- **Card counting simulation** with variable betting based on count

## Usage

### Interactive Mode
1. Click the **"Interactive"** tab to switch to interactive gameplay
2. Click **"Deal New Hand"** to start a new round
3. Use the action buttons (Hit, Stand, Double, Split, Surrender) to play your hand
4. View real-time statistics in the side panel
5. Enable **Developer Mode** to test specific card scenarios

### Simulator Mode
1. Click the **"Simulator"** tab for statistical analysis
2. Configure simulation parameters:
   - **Number of Players**: 1-6 players
   - **Number of Games**: From 10 to 10 million hands
   - **Number of Decks**: 1, 2, 4, 6, or 8 decks
   - **Strategy**: Basic Strategy or Conservative Strategy
3. Click **"Run Simulation"** to start
4. Monitor progress with the real-time progress indicator
5. Review comprehensive statistics when complete

## Game Statistics

Both modes track detailed statistics including:
- **Games**: Total hands played
- **Wins/Losses/Pushes**: Outcome breakdown
- **Blackjacks**: Natural 21s dealt
- **Busts**: Times player exceeded 21
- **Win Rate**: Percentage of hands won
- **Earnings**: Net monetary result
- **Total Bet**: Amount wagered
- **Return**: Return on investment percentage

## Strategies

### Basic Strategy
Implements mathematically optimal blackjack basic strategy based on:
- Player hand total (hard/soft)
- Dealer up card
- Pair splitting opportunities
- Double down situations

### Conservative Strategy
A more cautious approach with:
- Less aggressive doubling
- Conservative splitting
- Earlier standing on borderline hands

## Technologies Used

- **React 19** - Frontend framework with latest features
- **Vite** - Lightning-fast build tool and development server
- **JavaScript ES6+** - Modern JavaScript with JSX
- **CSS3** - Styling and animations
- **esbuild** - Ultra-fast JavaScript bundler (via Vite)
