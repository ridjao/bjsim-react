# Blackjack Simulator React

A comprehensive React-based blackjack simulator that provides both interactive gameplay and statistical simulation capabilities. This application allows users to play blackjack hands interactively or run large-scale simulations to analyze different strategies and scenarios.

## Features

### ðŸŽ® Interactive Mode
- **Play blackjack hands** with full game mechanics (hit, stand, double, split, surrender)
- **Real-time statistics** tracking wins, losses, pushes, blackjacks, busts, earnings, and win rates
- **Developer mode** for testing specific card scenarios
- **Basic strategy hints** to help improve gameplay
- **Hand history** showing detailed results of each hand played

### ðŸ“Š Simulator Mode
- **Large-scale simulations** supporting up to 10 million hands
- **Multiple strategies** including Basic Strategy and Conservative Strategy
- **Comprehensive statistics** matching interactive mode metrics
- **Progress indicator** with real-time updates for long-running simulations
- **Detailed hand tracking** for smaller simulations (â‰¤1000 hands)
- **Configurable parameters** for number of players, decks, and game count

### ðŸŽ¯ Game Features
- **Accurate blackjack rules** including proper payouts (3:2 for blackjacks)
- **Multiple deck support** (1, 2, 4, 6, or 8 decks)
- **Split hands support** with independent play of each hand
- **Double down** functionality with proper betting mechanics
- **Surrender option** for strategic play
- **Card counting simulation** with variable betting based on count

## Strategies

### Basic Strategy
Implements mathematically optimal blackjack basic strategy based on:
- Player hand total (hard/soft)
- Dealer up card
- Pair splitting opportunities
- Double down situations

### Conservative Strategy
A more cautious approach with:
- Less aggressive doubling
- Conservative splitting
- Earlier standing on borderline hands

## Technologies Used

- **React 19** - Frontend framework
